# Release Notes — v0.4.2 (2026-01-07)

## Highlights since v0.3.8

- **Registry-free distribution**: Portable ZIP now ships installer scripts (`install.ps1`, `install.sh`) that install Signaler into a user tool-cache and add a PATH launcher. The repo slug defaults to `Dendro-X0/signaler`.
- **Self-upgrade**: New `signaler upgrade` command downloads the latest GitHub Release portable zip and replaces the current install. Installers delegate to this when rerun.
- **Red issues report**: New human-first `red-issues.md` and `red-issues.json` surfaces the highest-priority problems across the suite.
- **CLI rename**: Primary command is `signaler`; `apex-auditor` remains as a compatibility alias.

## Upgrade guidance

1) From any shell (after initial install):

```bash
signaler upgrade
```

2) If not yet installed, download the latest `signaler-<version>-portable.zip` from GitHub Releases, run `./release-assets/install.ps1 -AddToPath` (Windows) or `./release-assets/install.sh --add-to-path` (macOS/Linux), then use `signaler` from any directory.

## Notable earlier increments

- **v0.4.0**: Added `pages[].scope` for public vs. auth-only routes; improved reporting and guidance for worst/failing combos; stabilized aggregation semantics.
- **v0.3.9**: Added AI-oriented packets (`ai-fix.json`, `ai-fix.min.json`, `ai-ledger.json`), median/p75 run stats, and faster controls for AI/export size.
- **v0.3.8**: Added `--diagnostics`, `--lhr`, `--flags`, `summary-lite.json`, `issues.json`, `diagnostics-lite/`, and `triage.md`, plus optional gzip artifacts and dynamic-route filtering.
