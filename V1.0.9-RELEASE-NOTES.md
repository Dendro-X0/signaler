# Version 1.0.9 Release Notes

**Release Date:** January 15, 2026  
**Status:** ✅ Published to JSR  
**Package:** `@signaler/cli@1.0.9`

## Critical Bug Fix

This release fixes a **critical circular dependency issue** that was causing runtime errors when installing from JSR.

### What Was Fixed

**Problem:** The package.json contained a circular dependency:
```json
"@signaler/cli": "npm:@jsr/signaler__cli@^1.0.8"
```

This caused the package to depend on itself from JSR, leading to:
- Runtime errors like `ENOENT: no such file or directory, scandir 'B:\-\BUN\root\locales/'`
- Installation failures
- Broken CLI execution

**Solution:** Removed the circular dependency from package.json and rebuilt the package.

### Installation

Users should now install the fixed version:

```bash
# Uninstall old version first
npm uninstall -g @jsr/signaler__cli

# Install fixed version
npx jsr add -g @signaler/cli
```

Or using deno:
```bash
deno install -Agf jsr:@signaler/cli
```

### Verification

After installation, verify it works:
```bash
signaler --version
```

This should display the help text without any errors.

## What Changed

- ✅ Removed circular dependency from package.json
- ✅ Rebuilt and verified local build works correctly
- ✅ Published to JSR: https://jsr.io/@signaler/cli@1.0.9
- ✅ Updated CHANGELOG.md
- ✅ Created git tag v1.0.9
- ✅ Pushed to GitHub

## For Users Experiencing Issues

If you're still experiencing the Bun error after upgrading:

1. **Completely uninstall the old version:**
   ```bash
   npm uninstall -g @jsr/signaler__cli
   npm uninstall -g @signaler/cli
   ```

2. **Clear npm cache:**
   ```bash
   npm cache clean --force
   ```

3. **Reinstall the fixed version:**
   ```bash
   npx jsr add -g @signaler/cli
   ```

4. **Verify installation:**
   ```bash
   which signaler  # or 'where signaler' on Windows
   signaler --version
   ```

## Technical Details

The circular dependency was introduced during the JSR publishing setup. The package was trying to import itself from JSR, which created an infinite loop in the dependency resolution. This has been completely removed in v1.0.9.

## Next Steps

- Monitor user feedback on the fix
- Consider adding automated tests to prevent circular dependencies in future releases
- Update documentation to reflect the corrected installation process
